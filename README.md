## Kanban App for the terminal written in rust
  This kanban app will allow the user to be more productive by prioritizing tasks and achieving goals faster
## Why?
  I am new to rust and wanted to learn the language in a project-oriented manner, feel free to drop feedback on my codeüòÅ. Another reason for building a TUI is that I spend the majority of my time in the terminal whether it is testing or running code or writing code in neovim. I haven't been able to find any other alternatives so I have started to make my own!
