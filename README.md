## Kanban App for the terminal written in rust
  This kanban app will allow the user to be more productive by prioritizing tasks and achieving goals faster
## Why?
  I am new to rust and wanted to learn the language in a project-oriented manner, feel free to drop feedback on my codeüòÅ. Another reason for building a TUI is that I spend the majority of my time in the terminal whether it is testing or running code or writing code in neovim. I haven't been able to find any other alternatives so I have started to make my own!
## Contribution
  Feel free to make a pull request or make a new issue, I am open to suggestions ‚úåÔ∏è
  I currently do not own a Mac so I am unable to test the app on Mac, if you can test it on Mac, please let me know if there are any issues.
## TODO
- [ ] Allow Card to be modified in Card View
- [ ] Add ability to export data to JSON / Switch to JSON for file saving (maybe? need to test the speed of JSON vs savefile binary)
- [ ] Implement Cloud saves (Google drive maybe? as I am not going to host a server)
- [ ] Implement a way to add custom colors (Theme support)
- [ ] Implement a way to add custom keybindings from the config file (maybe club this with the theme support)
- [ ] Implement animations for UI elements
- [ ] Implement a way to interact with the kanban board using the mouse (scrolling, dragging, etc)
- [ ] Implement a way to sync with other services like notion
- [ ] Write Tests
- [ ] Add a Tutorial for new users (Preferably in the app itself with animations and highlighting of UI elements)
## Completed Features
- [x] Implement a Command Palette (like in vs code (Ctrl + Shift + P)) as a way to interact with the app instead of using keybindings
- [x] Implement previews for loading a save
